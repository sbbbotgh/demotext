                                    Subject to clause 8.2, we offer a “no fix” policy in relation to our Device Repair Services, by which if we are unable to repair your device, you do not pay our full fee in relation to the products we have supplied. We will, however, be entitled to charge a call-out fee.
                                
                                This policy does not apply:

For example, if your device requires a screen replacement (completed successfully) and fixing the power button (not completed), this policy would apply to the costs of repairing the power button, but you would still be required to pay for the screen repair (but there would, in this example, be no additional call out charge); or</li>

                                We understand that people can become frustrated if matters do not proceed as they anticipated. However, if that frustration escalates to aggression towards Electroobuddy Staff then we consider that unacceptable. Any abusive or aggressive behaviour toward our staff will not be tolerated and will result in your Order being declined with immediate effect. Aggressive or abusive behaviour includes any language behaviour that may cause staff to feel afraid, alarmed, threatened or abused and may include threats, personal verbal abuse, derogatory remarks and rudeness. We also consider inflammatory statements, remarks of a racial or discriminatory nature and unsubstantiated allegations to be abusive behaviour.
